    <h4>GIS-AI 2025: 1st Workshop on Scalable GIS with AI: Data Integration, Real-Time Processing, and Ethical Challenges </h4>
    <p><h4></h4></p>
    The GIS-AI 2025 workshop is a premier event for researchers, practitioners, and industry leaders in the field of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). This year, we are excited to announce that the conference will be held in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, on November 24, 2025. Join us for a day of insightful talks, engaging discussions, and networking opportunities with experts from around the world.

    <p><h4></h4></p>
        The main goal of this workshop is to advance the development of scalable, high-performance GIS systems by exploring novel software, hardware, and architectural solutions. A key focus is on leveraging AI-driven techniques for data integration, outlier detection, and multi-source data consolidation to enhance the accuracy and reliability of GIS applications. The workshop will also address the ethical and regulatory challenges of AI in GIS, promoting transparency, privacy, fairness, and compliance through interdisciplinary collaboration. Additionally, it will highlight the role of GIS-backed geospatial AI analysis in risk management, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. Participants will discuss innovative data management approaches, including novel database systems and the integration of IoT and robotic data into GIS platforms. The workshop will also explore real-time and edge computing solutions for spatiotemporal data processing in field applications. A strong emphasis will be placed on fostering open-source development and community engagement, ensuring accessibility, interoperability, and cross-disciplinary collaboration to drive future innovations in GIS technology.

    <ul>
    <li>
        Submissions must be in an electronic form as PDF format and should be uploaded using the conference website. The submitted paper should be at most <strong>8-12 printed pages</strong> . Papers that fail to comply with length limit will be rejected. Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 peer reviewers. After the preliminary notification date, authors rebut by evidence and arguments all reviewer inquiries and their comments. Based on the rebuttal feedback, reviewers notify authors with the final decision. Selection criteria will include: relevance, significance, impact, originality, technical soundness, and quality of presentation. Preference will be given to submissions that take strong or challenging positions on important emergent topics related to Digital Ecosystems. At least one author should attend the conference to present the paper.
