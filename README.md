## Workshop Title: GIS-AI 2025 – Advancing Scalable GIS with AI: Data Integration, Real-Time Processing, and Ethical Challenges 

### Overview: 
The rapid growth of geospatial data, driven by advancements in remote sensing, IoT, and AI, has significantly increased the complexity of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Traditional GIS architectures struggle to handle the scalability, performance, and integration challenges posed by heterogeneous, large-scale datasets. Furthermore, AI-driven GIS applications must address critical concerns related to transparency, privacy, fairness, and regulatory compliance. As GIS becomes an essential tool for risk management, urban planning, and environmental monitoring, there is an urgent need for novel software, hardware, and data management solutions to enhance its efficiency, reliability, and accessibility.   
The main goal of this workshop is to advance the development of scalable, high-performance GIS systems by exploring novel software, hardware, and architectural solutions. A key focus is on leveraging AI-driven techniques for data integration, outlier detection, and multi-source data consolidation to enhance the accuracy and reliability of GIS applications. The workshop will also address the ethical and regulatory challenges of AI in GIS, promoting transparency, privacy, fairness, and compliance through interdisciplinary collaboration. Additionally, it will highlight the role of GIS-backed geospatial AI analysis in risk management, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. Participants will discuss innovative data management approaches, including novel database systems and the integration of IoT and robotic data into GIS platforms. The workshop will also explore real-time and edge computing solutions for spatiotemporal data processing in field applications. A strong emphasis will be placed on fostering open-source development and community engagement, ensuring accessibility, interoperability, and cross-disciplinary collaboration to drive future innovations in GIS technology.  
The GIS-AI 2025 workshop invites contributions focused on the integration of AI techniques into Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to address the challenges of data scalability, real-time processing, and ethical considerations. We seek original research, practical applications, and novel methodologies that enhance the performance, efficiency, and societal impact of GIS using AI and related technologies.
